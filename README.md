Demo Bundle Add-On
==================

This demo add-on will populate eXo Platform 4 with sample data for demonstration purposes. This includes:
- Users
- Social activities & comments
- Spaces
- Documents
- Wiki pages
- Calendar events
- Forum discussion
- etc.

It will also add new pages and mockup applications, such as :
- A mockup "Expenses Report" application accessible from the site's navigation menu.
- A mockup CRM application on the Sales Space's navigation menu.
- A "Favorites" application on the top toolbar (operational, not a mockup)
- An RSS application (operational, not a mockup)
- A news page displaying both news articles created within eXo (using WCM) and an external RSS feed.
